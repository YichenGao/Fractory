# Fractory


Developed a website using React and TypeScript to allow users to create fractal arts.
Implemented a user-friendly interface where users can freely choose colors, shapes, and the number of iterations for their fractals.
Utilized React components and state management to dynamically update the fractal display based on user input, providing an interactive and customizable experience.
